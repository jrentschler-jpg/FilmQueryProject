## Film Query Project

## Overview
Created a program from a command-line application that will get and display the film data that is being requested. The user will be able to pick from a menu to display film information requested from the film database.

## How It Works
User Story 1:
The user is presented with a menu in which they can choose to:

Look up a film by its id.
Look up a film by a search keyword.
Exit the application.

User Story 2:
If the user looks up a film by id, they are prompted to enter the film id. If the film is not found, they see a message saying so. If the film is found, its title, year, rating, and description are displayed.

User Story 3:
If the user looks up a film by search keyword, they are prompted to enter it. If no matching films are found, they see a message saying so. Otherwise, they see a list of films for which the search term was found anywhere in the title or description, with each film displayed exactly as it is for User Story 2.

User Story 4:
When a film is displayed, its language (English,Japanese, etc.) is also displayed.

User Story 5:
When a film is displayed, the list of actors in its cast is displayed along with the title, year, rating, and description.

## Resources Used
Java, SQL, MySQL, JDBC, Eclipse, ORM and ERDiagram

## Challenges
Some challenges I faced was marrying all of this together. Learning how to use object-relational mapping to get the data from database tables was very interesting to learn. Also, learning about a database accessor interface and then implementing those methods into a database accessor object (DAO) was nice to see - but I still need some more practice with it.

## Lessons Learned
This project was a nice blend of what we already know: Java and incorporating the new material we just learned: SQL, MySQL, JDBC, ORM and ERDiagram.

Having taken a break from OCA preparation, I enjoyed learning another language of SQL/MySQl considering it is a "non-programmers language". I enjoyed learning more about Databases and how they talk to one another in Java.

Having taken a step back after this project, I had to give myself a pat on the back. Looking back to Week 1 to where I am now, I can honestly say I am VERY proud of myself to see how much I have learned in such a short amount of time. I am very hard on myself, since I don't come from a computer programming background - so I want to make sure I put in the hard work to prove myself as a future FullStack Java Developer!
